// PURE zoom/refetch math for the IntervalHistory widget (issue #141). The history
// chart can be zoomed into a sub-span (Recharts Brush / drag-select) WITHOUT
// touching the global RangeControl. When the zoomed span is narrow, the widget
// refetches /api/interval for just that span so the user sees finer (less server-
// downsampled) detail instead of stretched decimated points.
//
// This module owns the two number/shaping decisions so they can be hand-calc
// unit-tested in isolation: (1) mapping a brushed [startMs, endMs] span to the
// route's YYYY-MM-DD day bounds, and (2) deciding whether a zoom warrants a
// finer-detail refetch. NO React / DOM / DB / fetch dependency.

const DAY_MS = 86_400_000;

// Convert an epoch-ms instant to a UTC YYYY-MM-DD day string. The /api/interval
// route parses `from`/`to` as UTC day bounds (Date.UTC(...,0,0,0) / 23:59:59.999),
// so we emit the UTC calendar day to stay consistent with how the route widens
// them. PURE.

// Map a brushed [startMs, endMs] span to inclusive UTC day bounds for /api/interval.
// The endpoints are ordered (a backwards drag still yields from ≤ to) and each is
// snapped to its UTC calendar day; the route then widens `to` to end-of-day so the
// full last day is captured. PURE.

// Decide whether a zoom into [startMs, endMs] should trigger a finer-detail
// refetch given the span currently fetched ([fetchedFromMs, fetchedToMs]).
//
// We refetch only when BOTH hold:
//   • the zoomed span is at most `maxSpanDays` wide — narrow enough that an
//     un-downsampled (or far-less-downsampled) fetch is worthwhile and bounded;
//   • the zoomed span is at most `shrinkRatio` of the currently-fetched span —
//     it is meaningfully narrower than what we already have, so a refetch buys
//     real extra detail rather than re-fetching ~the same window.
//
// Both guards are necessary: the span guard caps payload/effort; the shrink guard
// avoids a pointless refetch when the user brushes ~the whole current window.
// PURE — returns just the decision (the impure widget does the actual fetch).
